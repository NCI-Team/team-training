# Goals

- The trainee will understand the concepts of subnetting and apply them to design and implement IP addressing schemes in a Layer 2 network.
- The trainee will understand the concept and operation of VLANs.
- The trainee will be able to configure VLANs and verify their functionality.
- The trainee will understand the operation of Spanning Tree Protocol.

## Tasks

- **Subnetting**
  - Explain what is subnetting, and why is it needed.
  - Explain the limitations of classful addressing and how CIDR solved them.
  - Explain the difference between FLSM and VLSM. Why is VLSM usually preferred in modern networks? Provide an example.

  ### LAB

  - Using Packet Tracer:
    - You are a network engineer at a new company! The company has 3 departments: Core, BD, Platforms.
    - Each department has 2 PCs. You are given a 192.168.10.0/24 network.
        Subnet the 192.168.10.0/24 network into at least 3 subnets, one for each department.
    - Assign IP addresses to all PCs, ensuring:
            1. First usable IP is assigned to the first PC in each department.
            2. Use three switches (one per department) and one router.
            3. Configure router interfaces with the correct subnet IPs (Router-on-a-Stick if you want extra difficulty!).
    - Test connectivity:
      - PCs in the same department must ping each other.
      - PCs across departments must **NOT** ping each other.

- **Vlans**
  - What are VLANs and why are they used?  
  - What is the difference between trunk and access ports? How does VLAN tagging work in each?  
  - Explain the difference between the native VLAN and the default VLAN.

  ### LAB

  - Using Packet Tracer create the following lab using the addressing and port tables below:

  ##### Initial Port Assignment

    | Ports         | Assignment                     | Network            |
    |---------------|--------------------------------|--------------------|
    | Fa0/1 – 0/5  | 802.1q Trunks (Native VLAN 99)| 192.168.99.0 /24|
