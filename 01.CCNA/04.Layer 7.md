### Goals
- The trainee will learn how NTP operates, including its hierarchy and synchronization process.
- The trainee will understand the role and types of VPNs in networks.
- The trainee will understand the function and components of AAA.
- The trainee will learn about the key differences between TACACS+ and RADIUS.
- The trainee will be familiar with the different SNMP operations

### Tasks
- **NTP**
    - What is NTP? Why is accurate time synchronization important in computer networks?
    - Explain the NTP stratum hierarchy.
    - Describe the fields in an NTP packet.
    - How are the Originate Timestamp, Receive Timestamp and Transmit Timestamp fields used in NTP?
    - What is the difference between clock offset and round-trip delay?
    - Microchip's SyncServer is commonly used as an NTP server in networks, explain how it gets the correct time (using gnss).
    - How does the SyncServer keep providing correct time if the GNSS signal is lost?

- **VPN**
    - Read this [remote access vpn vs site to site vpn guide](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/remote-access-vpn-vs-site-to-site-vpn-full-guide)
    - Research the use of VPNs in private organizations, cloud environments, and general applications.
    - What is a Remote-Access VPN
    - What is a Site-to-Site VPN
    - Describe the step-by-step technical operation of a remote access VPN connection from the client initiating the connection to the secure traversal of data to the private network resources.
    - Detail the technical mechanism by which SSH inspection is performed, including how the traffic is intercepted, potentially decrypted and re-encrypted, and the points in the SSH connection process where this occurs.
    - Explain how IPsec's Security Associations (SAs) are established and maintained through the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol to define the parameters for securing data flows between VPN peers.

- **AAA**
    - What is an AAA server?
    - What are the three components of AAA, and what role does each play?
    - What are the main differences between TACACS+ and RADIUS regarding:
        1. Protocol used
        2. Encryption
        3. Separation of Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting
        4. Port numbers
        5. Use cases
        6. Vendor support
    - Why might an organization choose TACACS+ over RADIUS?
    - How do identity management tools differ from AAA servers?

- **SNMP**
    - What is SNMP?
    - What are SNMP agent and network management system (NMS)?
    - What is a MIB in SNMP?
    - What are the objects in a MIB? Why their ID means?
    - What are the six main SNMP protocol operations, and which side initiates each one?
    - What are the two first versions of SNMP, and what are their differences?
    - What is the role of an SNMP community string? What is the problem of using it?
    - Explain SNMPv3 and the role of USM in improving security.
