# Networking

## Overview
This part of the training focuses on advanced networking concepts beyond the CCNA level. It covers practical and high-level knowledge, including routed interfaces, link aggregation, multicast/anycast, BGP, and VXLAN, with hands-on labs and conceptual understanding to prepare for complex network designs and operations.

## Training Structure
| File Name             | Subjects Covered |
| --------------------- | ---------------- |
| `RoutedInterfaces` | Routed Interfaces: Differences between routed and switched interfaces, use cases, subinterfaces, and loopback interfaces. |
| `LinkAggregation`  | Link Aggregation: EtherChannel concepts, PortChannel configuration, LACP modes, VPC concepts, vPC domains, orphan ports, and peer-link operation. |
| `Anycast` | Anycast: Concepts, routing behavior, real-world use cases, benefits, and potential pitfalls. |
| `Multicast` | Multicast: Concepts, multicast IP ranges, IGMP and IGMP snooping, PIM dense and sparse modes, and multicast routing.                                                        |
| `BGP` | BGP: Autonomous Systems, eBGP vs iBGP, neighbor states, path attributes, best-path selection, communities, timers, route reflectors, and scaling mechanisms. |
| `VXLAN` | VXLAN: Purpose and advantages over VLANs, MAC-in-UDP encapsulation, VXLAN headers, spine-leaf architecture, VTEP operation, and flood-and-learn vs EVPN-based MAC learning. |
