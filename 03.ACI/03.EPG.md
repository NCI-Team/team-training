### Goals

- The trainee understand the concept of EPGs and uSeg.
- The trainee will understand how EPGs differ from regular VLAN.

### Tasks

- Explain what an Endpoint Group (EPG) is.
- Explain how EPGs differ from a normal Layer 2 VLAN.
- How does ACI handle communication between endpoints in different EPGs?
- How do EPGs relate to Bridge Domains and Application Profiles in ACI?
- When and why would you assign a subnet to an EPG rather than a Bridge Domain with a subnet?
- What is a uSeg (micro-segment) EPG in Cisco ACI, and how does it differ from a regular EPG?
- What are some use cases for deploying uSeg EPGs within a data center?
- What are ESGs? How do they differ from EPGs?
- Can uSeg EPGs be used to isolate workloads within the same VLAN or subnet, and how?
