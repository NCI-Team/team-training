### Goals

- The trainee understands the concept and purpose of Service Graphs in Cisco ACI.
- The trainee will understand how Service Graphs enable insertion of L4–L7 network services (such as firewalls, load balancers, or IPS/IDS) into the data path between EPGs
- The trainee will understand how these policies consume hardware resources such as TCAM entries on fabric switches.


### Questions


- What problem do Service Graphs solve in the ACI architecture, and why are they essential for integrating external services?
- How does a Service Graph control the insertion of L4–L7 services into the traffic path between Endpoint Groups?
- What is the function of the Service Graph template, and how does it translate into actual traffic behavior in the fabric?
- How does Cisco ACI maintain policy consistency when multiple Service Graphs or service devices are deployed?
- When the APIC “renders” a Service Graph, what happens in the fabric, and how does this process affect TCAM utilization on the leaf switches?
- What are the potential traffic-flow and operational effects of removing or modifying a Service Graph that is in use?
