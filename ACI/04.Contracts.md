# Goals

- The trainee understands the concept and purpose of Contracts in Cisco ACI.
- The trainee will understand how Contracts control communication between Endpoint Groups (EPGs) and how they differ from traditional ACLs or firewall rules.

## Tasks

- What is a Contract in ACI, and what is its primary function?
- What is the difference between a Contract, a Filter, and a Subject in ACI?
- Read about how default permit or default deny behavior works in ACI without Contracts.
- Read about how intra-EPG communication is handled and whether Contracts are required in this case.
- What is the difference between consumer and provider EPG roles in a Contract?
- How does directionality (bidirectional vs. unidirectional) affect Contract behavior?
- What happens if multiple Contracts are applied between the same EPGs?
- How can you apply a Contract between VRFs (cross-VRF communication) and what are the considerations?
- What is the relationship between Contracts and vzAny?
- How does the taboo contract feature work in ACI?
- How does a Contract interact with external networks via L3Out?
- What is the impact of deleting a Contract that is actively in use by EPGs?
- What are implicit rules, and what common types does ACI create automatically?
- In an intra-VRF EPG-to-EPG contract, where is the policy enforced when the destination endpoint is already learned?
- Explain the difference between ingress and egress policy enforcement in VRFs, and why ingress is generally recommended.
