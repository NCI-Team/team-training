# Goals

- The trainee will understand how STP work.
- The trainee will be familiar with the different types of STP.

## Tasks

- Explain what is broadcast storm. How does it happen?
- Watch [Introduction to Spanning-Tree](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ISNTZgiywO8)
- Watch [How Spanning-Tree Works](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5xMcvfn61-E)
- How does STP create a loop-free topology?
- What is a root bridge in STP, and how is it chosen?
- What is the function of a designated port in STP?
- What is BPDU message? In what situations this message is sent? What it contains?
- What information is used to determine the preferred link to the root bridge?
- Describe the process by which STP selects a root bridge and how other switches determine their best connection path towards the root bridge. How is the Bridge ID (BID) determined, and what factors influence root bridge election?
- Detail the different STP port states
- Explain the purpose and operation of advanced STP features like PortFast, BPDU Guard, and BPDU Filter.
- Explain the concept of Per-VLAN Spanning Tree Plus (PVST+) and how it differs from traditional STP, including the role of VLAN IDs in the Bridge ID calculation.
- What are the port states in RSTP? What are the differences between those states to the regular STP's states?
