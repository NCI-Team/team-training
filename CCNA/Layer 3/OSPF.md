### Goals

- The trainee will realize how does the dynamic routing ospf work  

### OSPF

- Read this document about OSPF: [OSPF.pdf](https://www.routeralley.com/guides/ospf.pdf)
- Watch this lesson about OSPF: [OSPF deep dive](https://app.pluralsight.com/library/courses/protocol-deep-dive-ospf/table-of-contents)
- Explain the role of the Hello protocol in OSPF and the information exchanged in Hello messages.
- How do OSPF routers build a neighbor table, and what fields are typically included?
- What conditions must be met for two OSPF routers to become neighbors?
- Describe the process of building the Link State Database (LSDB) in OSPF, including the exchange of Link State Advertisements (LSAs) and Link State Updates (LSUs).
- What is the primary metric OSPF uses to determine the best path, and how can this be manipulated to influence path selection?
- Explain the different types of OSPF messages and their purpose in establishing and maintaining OSPF adjacencies and synchronizing LSDBs.
- Describe the function of different LSA types (Type 1, Type 2, Type 3) and the information they carry.
- Why are passive interfaces used in OSPF?
- Explain the issue that arises when using OSPF in broadcast networks and how the introduction of Designated Router (DR) and Backup Designated Router (BDR) helps address this problem.
- Describe the different OSPF neighbor states and what happens in each state.
- Explain the concept of multi-area OSPF and the roles of Area Border Routers (ABRs), Backbone Routers, and Autonomous System Border Routers (ASBRs).
- An OSPF adjacency is stuck in the EXSTART or EXCHANGE state. While basic connectivity and other OSPF parameters appear correct, what issue could be causing this specific problem state
