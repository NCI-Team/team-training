# TCP

## Q&A

    1. Describe in detail the enrire TCP connection lifecycle - connection establishement, data transmissions and connection termination.
    2. How does TCP control the traffic flow in a connection? What is sliding window mechanism?
    3. How does TCP manages congestion conrol?
    4. What are the differences between TCP flow control and TCP congestion control?
    5. During a TCP session packet loss can occur, can TCP detect such an event? If so, how does it handle it?
    6. TLS (Transport Layer Security) works on top of TCP, what features of TCP does TLS depend on?
    7. Explain about how the TLS handshake works over TCP and at which point is the connection cosidered encrypted.
