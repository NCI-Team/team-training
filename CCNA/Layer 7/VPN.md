### Goals
- The trainee will learn about VPN
- The trainee will know how to manage CheckPoint VPN

### Tasks
- Read this turorial about VPN: [Defining-a-VPN.pdf](http://scitechconnect.elsevier.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/Defining-a-VPN.pdf)
- Read [remote-access-vpn-vs-site-to-site-vpn-full-guide](https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/remote-access-vpn-vs-site-to-site-vpn-full-guide) and answer the following questions:
   - What is a Remote-Access VPN
   - What is a Site-to-Site VPN
- Explain how different VPN types (e.g., IPsec Tunnel mode, GRE over IPsec, DMVPN) impact routing protocol behavior and network topology design in a large-scale enterprise WAN.
- Describe the step-by-step technical operation of a remote access VPN connection from the client initiating the connection to the secure traversal of data to the private network resources.
- How does deep packet inspection (DPI) function at the application layer (Layer 7) to analyze HTTP traffic, particularly in identifying and classifying different types of web content or applications?
- Detail the technical mechanism by which SSH inspection is performed, including how the traffic is intercepted, potentially decrypted and re-encrypted, and the points in the SSH connection process where this occurs.
- Explain how IPsec's Security Associations (SAs) are established and maintained through the Internet Key Exchange (IKE) protocol to define the parameters for securing data flows between VPN peers.
