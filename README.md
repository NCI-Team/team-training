# Welcome to the Networks Team Training

Welcome to the Networks team! This training is designed to help you build a strong foundation in networking concepts, protocols, and practical configurations, while also giving you hands-on experience with Cisco ACI and advanced network services.

Throughout this training, you'll cover CCNA-level fundamentals like VLANs, routing, OSPF, TCP/UDP, DHCP, and SNMP, as well as advanced topics including BGP, VXLAN, multicast, anycast, and link aggregation. You will also dive deep into Cisco ACI concepts, including tenants, VRFs, EPGs, bridge domains, contracts, L3Out, service graphs, BFD, monitoring, network load balancers, and full configuration labs.

The tasks in each section are a starting point. To truly master these topics:
- Read vendor documentation, RFCs, and technical blogs.
- Experiment in labs and explore configurations beyond the instructions.
- Ask questions, discuss with teammates, and share your findings.

By combining structured learning with curiosity and hands-on practice, you'll gain both practical skills and the conceptual knowledge needed to operate and design complex network environments.
